I don't know when spring will come,
The rains will pass, the snows will come off...
But you are my dear street
And in bad weather, the road

Everything here is close to me, everything is familiar,
Everything in my biography is
the door of the Komsomol district committee,
A family of trusted friends.

On this street as a teenager
Chasing pigeons on the roofs,
And here, at this intersection,
I met with my love.

Now I'm not happy that I've met you-
My soul is full of you.
Why, why in the world
There is unrequited love!

When on Zarechnaya Street
The lights are out in the houses,
Open-hearth furnaces are burning,
They burn day and night.

I don't want a different fate.,
I can't trade it for anything.
That factory entrance,
That she brought me out into the world.

There are many nice streets in the world,
But I'm not changing the address.
You have become the main one in my life,
My native street.
